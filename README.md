# Paolo Mangia

Passionate about coding with 5 years experience in Web Design and Mobile Development. I'm always looking for the coolest and most recent programming technology to learn and use for my upcoming projects. I'm highly intrested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies but at the same time i'm discovering and getting intrigued by the world of machine learning and chat bots.

I've worked for the past year for an Italian startup called TIP srls as a Full Stack Developer. The startup aimed at creating a payment system which is based on cryptography and high security, my task was to develop the platform and maintain it with a watchful eye on delivering the best user experience. Untill recently, i collaborated as a freelancer with PWC Italy to develop a strong authentication solution based on blockchain and then integrated it with already existing bank applications.

I’m currently freelancing while I pursue new opportunities and can be reached either through this profile, by phone at +34 685399482 or on skype @scratur3.

When i'm not working, depending on the weather, i'm outside skating with my longboard or at home messing around with tech toys and pc components. I love travelling and i'd higly consider a working experience outside of my country.

- find an appealing relocation place/job.
- write atricles about programming on my new blog "paolomangiadev.eu"​
- mess around with Alexa, chat bots and learn Solidity
